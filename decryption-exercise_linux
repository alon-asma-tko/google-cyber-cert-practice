In this fun scenario, I encountered encrypted data and followed clues to recover it. 
After finding a hidden file named ".leftShift3" in the "caesar" subdirectory, I decrypted its 
content using a Caesar cipher to reveal instructions for decrypting the main encrypted file. 
Following these instructions, I used the OpenSSL command with the provided passphrase "ettubrute" to decrypt the file successfully. 
Through this exercise, I practiced deciphering encrypted data and gained experience in using encryption and decryption tools.

-- Command 1: Accessed the README.txt file to find instructions for recovering encrypted data.

Hello,
All of your data has been encrypted. To recover your data, you will need to solve a cipher. To get started look for a hidden file in the caesar subdirectory.

-- Command 2: Navigated to the "caesar" subdirectory to explore hidden files.
analyst@06c70eea7b8c:~$ cd caesar

-- Command 3: Accessed the hidden file ".leftShift3" to retrieve decryption instructions.
analyst@06c70eea7b8c:~/caesar$ cat .leftShift3

rshqvvo dhv-256-fef -sengi2 -d -g -lq T1.hqfubswhg -rxw T1.uhfryhuhg -n hwwxeuxwh

-- Command 4: Used the "tr" command to apply a Caesar cipher decryption to reveal instructions.
analyst@06c70eea7b8c:~/caesar$ cat .leftShift3 | tr "d-za-cD-ZA-C" "a-zA-Z"
In order to recover your files you will need to enter the following command:

openssl aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -a -d -in Q1.encrypted -out Q1.recovered -k ettubrute

-- Command 5: Decrypted the main encrypted file "Q1.encrypted" using the OpenSSL command with the provided passphrase.
analyst@06c70eea7b8c:~/caesar$ cd ~
analyst@06c70eea7b8c:~$ openssl aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -a -d -in Q1.encrypted -out Q1.recovered -k ettubrute

-- Command 6: Verified the successful decryption by viewing the recovered file "Q1.recovered".
analyst@06c70eea7b8c:~$ cat Q1.recovered
If you are able to read this, then you have successfully decrypted the classic cipher text. You recovered the encryption key that was used to encrypt this file. Great work!
