Developed hands-on experience in performing various types of SQL joins and data retrieval operations in a MariaDB
environment. Gained proficiency in joining tables, filtering data, and extracting information from multiple datasets.


-- Query 1: Performing an inner join between the machines and employees tables based on the device_id.
-- Achieved: Gained experience in combining data from two tables using an inner join operation.

SELECT * 
FROM machines 
INNER JOIN employees ON machines.device_id = employees.device_id;


-- Query 2: Performing a left join between the machines and employees tables based on the device_id.
-- Achieved: Practiced left join to retrieve all records from the left table (machines) and matching records from the right table (employees).

SELECT * 
FROM machines 
LEFT JOIN employees ON machines.device_id = employees.device_id;

-- Query 3: Performing a right join between the machines and employees tables based on the device_id.
-- Achieved: Explored right join to retrieve all records from the right table (employees) and matching records from the left table (machines).

SELECT * 
FROM machines 
RIGHT JOIN employees ON machines.device_id = employees.device_id;


-- Query 4: Performing an inner join between the employees and log_in_attempts tables based on the username.
-- Achieved: Further practiced inner join to combine employee information with login attempts data.

SELECT * 
FROM employees 
INNER JOIN log_in_attempts ON employees.username = log_in_attempts.username;
